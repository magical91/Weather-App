# Weather-App

In this week's project I completed the assignment of creating a weather app using a third-party API. As the user opens the page, he or she will be able to search for the desired city. As a city is searched, the main content will display the current weather of the searched city. In the current content you will find the present temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index and an icon portraying the actual sky image. Also below the main content a 5 day forecast with similar information will be displayed. Every time a city is searched it will be added to "recent searches" display with the ability to clear out the content when the user pleases.

## Purpose
